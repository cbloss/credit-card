A coding challenge based on https://codepen.io/JavaScriptJunkie/pen/YzzNGeR

A few things that I still need to tackle:
- The input focus is still clunky. The spacing isn't right nor any fun animation. I was mainly looking at the Vue functionality.
- I didn't create this for responsive-ness. 
- Cross browser compatiable. I coded this in Chrome. I know Firefox has the select drop down funky-ness. 
- Form Validation.
